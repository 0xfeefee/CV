# CV (v0.1)
This is just a basic demo of programming skills, not a real product.

## Project structure & setup
- [bin/](./bin): build output directory.
- [build/](./build): CMake build scripts.
- [scripts/](./scripts): Scripts you can call to build/run the project.
- [docs/](./docs): project documentation (CHANGELOG, screenshots, profiler/debugger files, etc.)
- [src/](./src): all project source files.
- [vendor/](./vendor): all 3rd party source code and libraries.

### Dependencies
In order to make builds as pleasant as possible all dependencies ship with the project, if
there's not enough space they will be shipped as a git submodule instead.
